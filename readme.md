### CreativeIris
A simple machine learning classifier, built with Python and the SciPi libraries
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn


### Dataset Information
What do the instances in this dataset represent?
Each instance is a plant, with a set of parameters, and the class of the plant.

- The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. 
- There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. 
- The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. 
- All observed flowers belong to one of three species.


### Additional Information
This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.
The dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.

### Workflow
1) Setup environment, check Python library versions etc.
2) Look at the data, check statistics, and visualize it.
3) Perform any pre-processing, like data scaling (not applicable in this simple case with the Iris data).
4) Build and evaluate the models (e.g. with K-fold cross validation). 
5) Make predictions.
